# Natural-Language-Processing :

- CSV = Comma Separated Values.
- TSV = Tab Separated Values.
- (" ") Must be a problem of TSV file
- (,) Must be a problem of CSV file
- When we use TSV file and import the dataset, we must use [delimiter = '\t', quoting = 3]
- use [quoting = 3] for remove the (" ")

## Cleaning the text :
 - When we clean the text,we need a library called (re)
    #### import re
    #### review = re.sub() 
         - sub is a function
